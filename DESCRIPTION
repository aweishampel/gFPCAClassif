Description: Methods for classifying binary data through incorporating functional data analysis principal components (FPCA). 
    The provided functions model and train classifiers for binary-valued functional data. The package presents model-based classification methods for the binary-valued functional data. The package accounts for multiple different scenarios of the data. All of these models are built under the assumption that the binary data are binary-valued observations of smooth latent functions. gFPCAClassif includes methods for modeling the data using generalized single-level FPCA (gsFPCA), generalized multi-level FPCA (gmFPCA), and generalized multi-level FPCA with inactive periods (gmFPCA+gAR).
